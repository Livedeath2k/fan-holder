# Fan holder for pc housing fans
Project name: fan-holder

In my project the dimensions are made for 120mm pc housing fans.  
But you can easily create new versions for different fan sizes.  
The goal is to provide a nice alternative to common fans to provide air cooling in indoor areas.  
Or have special gimmick at home.

I provide two different versions. The first is a module for one fan and the second for 4 fans.

## ToDo
- Design feets to prevent topple over.
- The fans need an external power supply.
- A control module with pwm to control fan speeds and/or fan colors would be nice.
- Stackable modules? Maybe possible with noses and indents at the edges of a module?
- Which file formats are acceptable?
